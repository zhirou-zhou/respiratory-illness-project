# Respiratory Illness Project
This is the final project of BST-432 High Dimensional Data Analysis. 

The project aims to apply Decision Tree and Random forest to predit whether an infant had a respiratory illness at a particular visit to hospital. 

The target variables are 'is_illness' and 'precedes_illness', whose values are 'TRUE' or 'FALSE', representing whether the infant had an illness or precedes illness.
